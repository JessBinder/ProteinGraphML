# ProteinGraphML



NOTE:: to begin add your DB creds to the DBcreds.yaml file, without a database you cannot run the 'Build_Graph' notebook

# that will build a graph on which metapath ML features are created 

# you can use the ML Example notebook with just a graph, but you will need to generate it before hand



# will be adding details to this readme in the coming days
